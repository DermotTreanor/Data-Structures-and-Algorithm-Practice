Two common areas where we will use recursion are:
	
	- **Repeated Executions**: This is where we are repeatedly executing a task over and over agaion. It can be very similar to a loop and often we will want to pass a parameter to act even more like a loop (which we pass in recursive functions and can increment or decrement accordinly)
	
	- **Subproblem Calculations**: This is where we will make calculations based on a subproblem at hand. 
		A subproblem is a problem that is the same as the original but is based on a smaller amount of input.


I need to look more into the differences between a top-down and bottom-up approach and what these are


**A top-down recursive approach lets us shift everything off to the subproblem. We just imagine that the function we will call (that is actually the one we are writing will work perfectly). We relax our brains, and shift all the workload onto the subproblem.**
